# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about the OS-Type
# and compiled in modules.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minimal | Minor | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
#
#ServerTokens Minimal
ServerTokens <%= node[:apache][:servertokens] %> 

#
# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
#
#ServerSignature Off
ServerSignature <%= node[:apache][:serversignature] %> 

#
# Allow TRACE method
#
# See CVE-2004-2320, CVE-2007-3008
#
# Set to "extended" to also reflect the request body (only for testing and
# diagnostic purposes).
#
# Set to one of:  On | Off | extended
#
#TraceEnable Off
TraceEnable <%= node[:apache][:traceenable] %>

# There is a DoS attack against apache relating to how it handles
# range request headers. If they're not something your site needs, you
# can just disable them. This will probably be fixed by Q4 2011
